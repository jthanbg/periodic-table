An incomplete periodic table with all the elements and a brief description of their characteristics as well as a night mode and animations. 
This periodic table was made utilizing JavaScript as well as HTML and CSS. I specifically used CSS Grid to place all the elements in their positions on the periodic table. 
*May break on other devices. *The elements and their information are in Spanish. *Added neutronium for the shits and giggles :)
